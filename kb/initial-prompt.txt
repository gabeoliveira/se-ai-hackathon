TOPIC: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
QUESTION: Business Continuity Plan
ANSWER: Twilio is a cloud-communication platform hosted on AWS. Twilio's voice and messaging infrastructure is distributed across multiple fault-independent regions and data centers served by our provider. Twilio maintains redundant inbound and outbound connectivity with multiple network carriers and real-time systems to dynamically route each call or message via the carrier with the best connectivity at any point in time responding automatically to carrier availability and reliability. Twilio's software redundant infrastructure can also detect and route around issues experienced by hosts or even whole data centers in real time.

TOPIC: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
QUESTION: High level BCDR Plan
ANSWER: Since Twilio is a cloud first company and no critical business process are tied to our physical offices all employees are able to work remotely at any time. If power / internet is still up in San Francisco after a disaster then no continuity plans would need to be enacted. Teams at Twilio can work remotely for up to 3 months and many longer without meeting in person. Additionally should an event happen in the Bay Area we have a Mountain View office (if not impacted) where the eTeam and key personnel could meet in person.   If an event happens in the Bay Area knocking out power and internet Twilio could move operations by transporting key San Francisco-based personnel to any location with an internet connection. This could be to any of our other offices or a temporary space closer to San Francisco depending on the severity and type of event that occurs.  Twilio's Support team is already our most geographically dispersed team so there would be no need to relocate our support operations. We do not have a traditional call center.

TOPIC: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
QUESTION: BCDR backup zones
ANSWER: Twilio Services Hosted in AWS (US East) Backups are located in AWS US West Region. Twilio product teams have historically been responsible for uptime and resiliency of their products. Twilio has architected our environment with availability and resiliency as the number one priority. Customers can always check on the operational status of all Twilio products at  https://status.twilio.com/.   Hosting our services on AWS gives Twilio the ability to remain resilient globally even if one location goes down. AWS spans multiple geographic regions and availability zones which allow Twilio servers to remain resilient in the event of most failure modes including natural disasters or system failures. Twilio maintains redundant inbound and outbound connectivity with multiple network carriers and real-time systems to dynamically route each call or message via the carrier with the best connectivity at any point in time responding automatically to carrier availability and reliability. Twilio's software redundant infrastructure can also detect and route around issues experienced by hosts or even whole data centers in real time.  All Twilio services operate several AWS Availability Zones within the US-East region. Twilio's software redundant infrastructure can also detect and route around issues experienced by hosts or even whole data centers in real time. Our orchestration tooling has the ability to regenerate hosts building them from the latest backup. Twilio performs regular backups of Twilio account information call records call recordings and other critical data using Amazon S3 cloud storage. All backups are encrypted in transit and at rest using strong encryption. Backup files are stored redundantly across multiple availability zones and are encrypted. Should there be an incident Twilio maintains an incident response program in accordance to NIST SP 800-61. The program defines conditions under which security incidents are classified and triaged. Twilio Security Incident Response Team or T-SIRT assesses the threat of all relevant vulnerabilities or security incidents and establishes remediation and mitigation actions for all events.

QUESTION: RTO/RPO SLA Business Impact Analysis
ANSWER: Twilio for most use cases stores phone numbers and Voice Call/SMS metadata (timestamp etc). Please discuss specific use cases with the sales rep to determine exact data points that Twilio will transmit/process/store Currently we are in the process of pulling together our BCP/DR programs together into a formalized company-wide program. Once this is in place we will begin testing these plans and from this testing we will be able to determine our RTO/RPO times however we cannot commit to timelines as of yet.  However we will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain our SLA of 99.95% uptime and rely on our service credits to maintain this (https://www.twilio.com/legal/service-level-agreement). Along with this our customers can monitor the real-time status of Twilio’s service using https://status.twilio.com/

TOPIC: Cloud Security
QUESTION: Customer data isolation / multi-tenancy
ANSWER: Twilio is hosted on AWS which is multi-tenant. Multi-tenancy is an integral component of Twilio's architecture as well. We make sure that one client's data is not shared with other clients using logical identifiers.

TOPIC: Cloud Security
QUESTION: Multi-tenancy Expanded
ANSWER: Twilio is hosted on AWS which is multi-tenant. Twilio has implemented logical separation between customers using logical identifiers tagging all communications data with the associated Customer ID to clearly identify ownership. Twilio applications are designed and built to honor these tags and enforce access controls to ensure the confidentiality and integrity requirements for each customer are appropriately addressed (similar to the way that traditional telephony or Internet traffic traverses a shared set of infrastructure). These controls are reviewed and vetted by our security engineering team as a part of their application security assessment process to ensure one customer's communications can not be accessed by a different customer. The specific way that tagging is implemented and enforced varies by product based on the nature of the data and storage but Twilio maintains strong segmentation between customers and our current implementation is effective across our product lines.

TOPIC: Cloud Security
QUESTION: Logical Identifiers Expanded
ANSWER: These logical identifiers aren't really tags but are values within a specific row within the database. These values indicate which account owns the data for a given row. As such these values are immutable and we don't provide a way through our API or services to update the ownership of a given record or row in the database once it has been written. When we are querying this data the owning account is always provided as a portion of the where clause. If the proper owning account is not provided then it is impossible for the data to be returned to the caller. While the customer does pass the account as part of the URL when fetching data that value is validated against the authentication token that is provided. This means someone can't just merely guess the resource sid and account sid in order to fetch the data from another account. They must also know the auth token for the account. This is generally what protects the records. In addition to this protection the data is encrypted at rest. Critical PII data that includes things like Message Bodies or the Audio recording of a phone call are additional field level encrypted with a unique key per account. This is to protect against a data breach or a situation where someone may have exfiltrated a single customers encryption key. As they would need the key that is specific to that account and product (different keys are used for each product's data). One other mechanism that is available to customers is to make use of Twilio Connect. It would provide a private network for the customer to use when accessing their Twilio account. Some of our more cautious customers choose to do this rather than making API accesses over the public internet.
